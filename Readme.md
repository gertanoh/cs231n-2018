# Standford CS231n (2018) : Convolutional networks for Visual Recognition
After long hours of wathcing videos and reading notes at [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/),
I was able to implement the solutions to the three assignments.
The second assignment was by the far the hardest and the most rewarding.

The course is really really good, with low-level assignments(backpropagation, convolution, batch normalization) and 
high-level materials and assignments(PyTorch, GAN, Saliency Maps).
For the training, I mostly used a VM from the course on Google Compute Engine with CPUs.
I used Google Colab GPU for the Q5 of the assignment2.

## [Assignment 1](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2018/assignment1/)

All the props go to the CS231n team (Justin Johnson, Serena Yeung and the TAs) that delivered the course and the assignments(also for making the videos and assignments available for free).
Thanks to Haofei Xu for sharing her solutions online, they have been helpful during these assignments, specially in assignment 2.
